# Exploring spatial indices and the hansen global forest change product

## 1. What will you learn from this module?

1. Exploring and calculating Spectral indices such as;
 - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),
 - Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI),
 - Land Surface Water Index (LSWI),
 - Tasseled Cap Greenness (TC-G),
 - Tasseled Cap Brightness (TC-B),
 - Tasseled Cap Wetness (TC-W), in Google Earth Engine (GEE)
2. Introduction to the Hansen et al. Global Forest Change Data in Google Earth Engine (GEE).




## 2. Course overview

Spectral Indices are combinations of spectral reflectance from two or more wavelengths that indicate the relative abundance of features of interest. There are different indices for vegetation, built-up features, water and burned areas.
In this section we will have hands-on tutorial exploring some vegetation indices in the Google Earth Engine environment.<br>
The Hansen Global Forest Change is the results from time-series analysis of Landsat images in characterizing global forest extent and change from 2000 through 2020.
The Hansen et al. (2013) Global Forest Change dataset in Earth Engine represents forest change, at 30 meters resolution, globally, between 2000 and 2020.
In this section, we will explore the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset in Google Earth Engine for forest cover and loss estimation.




**After this module you'll be able to:**

- Compute spectral indices and other indices such as geological indices in Google Earth Engine
- Explore and use the Hansen Global Forest Change yearly datasets for forest cover and forest loss estimation.
