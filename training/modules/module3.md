# Time series and user interface customisation in google earth engine

## 1. What will you learn from this module?

1. Customising of Graphical User Interface in  Earth Engine ;
 - Widgets,
 - Panels and Layout,
 - Events,

2. Time-Series Charts
3. Publishing your App 





## 2. Course overview

Spectral Indices are combinations of spectral reflectance from two or more wavelengths that indicate the relative abundance of features of interest. There are different indices for vegetation, built-up features, water and burned areas.
In this section we will have hands-on tutorial exploring some vegetation indices in the Google Earth Engine environment.<br>
The Hansen Global Forest Change is the results from time-series analysis of Landsat images in characterizing global forest extent and change from 2000 through 2020.
The Hansen et al. (2013) Global Forest Change dataset in Earth Engine represents forest change, at 30 meters resolution, globally, between 2000 and 2020.
In this section, we will explore the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset in Google Earth Engine for forest cover and loss estimation.




**After this module you'll be able to:**

- Customise your earth engine Application
- Publish GEE app 
- Develop a time series App in GEE
