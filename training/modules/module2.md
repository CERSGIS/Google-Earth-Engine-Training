# Data Exploration in Google Earth Engine 

## 1. What will you learn from this module?

- Basic Concept in GEE
- Import Image/ Image Collection and Feature/Feature Collection
- Display and Visualize Image/ Image Collection and Feature/Feature Collection
- Perform basic Image/ Image Collection analysis such as filtering, cloud masking, mosaicking and compositing
- Perform basic Feature/ Feature Collection analysis such as filtering, merging, clipping
- Export  Image/ Image Collection and Feature/Feature Collection





## 2. Course overview

This course will introduce you to Image/ Image Collection and Feature and Feature Collection and basic analysis such as filtering, mosaicking, compositing, merging performed on them. In this module, you will also get to know how to import and visualize both Image/ Image Collection and Feature and Feature Collection and exporting the data in GEE



**After this module you'll be able to:**

- How to import Image/Image Collection and Feature/Feature Collection
- How to filter, mosaic, composite and cloud masking an image collection and an image in GEE.
- How to filter and merge Feature/Feature Collection
- How to export both Image/Image Collection and Feature/Feature Collection
