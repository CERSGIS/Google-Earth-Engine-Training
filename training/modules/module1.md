## 1. What will you learn from this module?

- Overview  of GEE
- Introduction to JavaScript
- GEE objects, strings, lists ,Arrays
- Interaction  to GitHub   interface 




## 2. Course overview

This course will introduce you to Google Earth Engine (GEE). Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform that enables large-scale processing of satellite imagery to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earthâ€™s surface.<br>
In this module you'll get an overview of GEE Code Editor interface and you'll learn the basics of JavaScript, the programming language that is used in the GEE Code Editor. 




**After this module you'll be able to:**

- Understand the capabilities of Google Earth Engine and its use of parallel processing
- Use Google Earth Engine Code Editor interface
- Use JavaScript for writing scripts in the Google Earth Engine Code Editor Interface
