## 1. What will you learn from this module?

1. Customising of Graphical User Interface in  Earth Engine 
    - Widgets
    - Panels and Layout
    - Events
2. Time-Series Charts
3. Publishing your App 





## 2. Course overview

Earth Engine comes with a User Interface API that allows you to build an interactive web application powered by Earth Engine. Building a web mapping application typically requires the skills of a full stack developer and are out of reach for most analysts and scientists. But the Earth Engine User Interface API makes this process much more accessible by providing ready-to-use widgets, such as Buttons, Drop-down Menus, Sliders etc. - and free cloud hosting to allow anyone to publish an app with just a few lines of code.<br>

The apps run in your browser, so they need to use client-side functions. All the user interface functions are contained in the ui. package - such as **ui.Select(), ui.Button()**. You can create those elements by calling these functions with appropriate parameters. The main container object is the ui.Panel() which can contain different types of widgets. Learn more in the Earth Engine User Interface API section of the Earth Engine User Guide.




**After this module you'll be able to:**

- Customise your earth engine Application
- Publish GEE app 
- Develop a time series App in GEE
