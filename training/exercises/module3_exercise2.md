# Module 1 - Exercise 

## 1. Description

In this exercise, we will add and visualize the masked treecover, forest loss and forest gain bands in the Western North Region of Ghana for 2020. Apply a canopy cover of 70% on the Region of Interest and compute the yearly forest loss area.



## 2. Skills Practices

This exercise covers:

- Explore and use the Hansen Global Forest Change yearly datasets for forest cover and forest loss estimation.




## 3. Instruction

1. Import the global forest change dataset for 2020 and the regional boundary of Ghana.  Filter Western North region as the region of interest.
2. Create and visualize the treecover (green and black), forest loss (red) and forest gain (blue) bands masking out non-forest areas clipping it to the region of interest.

2. Apply and mask the canopy cover greater than 70% of the tree cover clipped to the region of interest. Visualize it as yellow.

3. Compute the area of the yearly forest loss and convert the values from 0-20 to 2000-2020.
