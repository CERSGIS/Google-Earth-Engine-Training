## Introduction

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform that enables large-scale processing of satellite imagery to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earthâ€™s surface. This course covers the full range of topics in Earth Engine to give the participants practical skills to master the platform and implement their remote sensing projects.

## Objectives

The main objective is to train GIS and Remote Sensing Experts on the SCAFS project in the basics of satellite image
processing in the [Google Earth Engine (GEE)](https://earthengine.google.com/) Environment by leveraging on the Google Earth
high-resolution imagery and the GEE cloud-based data processing capacities for land use
mapping, spatiotemporal analysis on forest monitoring and cartographic visualization.

1. Introduce the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) model
2. Work through application examples
3. Facilitate a dissemination workshop on the map outputs

	
## Sign-up for Google Earth Engine

- If you already have a Google Earth Engine account, you can skip this step.
- Visit https://signup.earthengine.google.com/ and sign-up with your Google account. You can use your existing gmail account to sign-up. It usually takes 1-2 days 	  for approval. Hence do this step as soon as possible.

Tips to ensure smooth sign-up process:

- Use Google Chrome browser.
- When signing up for Earth Engine, please log out of all Google accounts and ensure you are logged into only 1 account which you want associated with Earth Engine.



## Computer hardware and software
> :pushpin:  Google Earth Engine runs from an internet browser. No specific software needs to be installed. For best performance the Chrome browser is recommended. Furthermore an internet connection is required, because all work is done online.



## Prerequisites 
- Fundamental understanding of basic remote sensing
- Prior understanding of the basic concepts of programming is not required but may be helpful
