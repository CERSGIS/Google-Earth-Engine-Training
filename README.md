## Introduction

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform that enables large-scale processing of satellite imagery to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth’s surface. This course covers the full range of topics in Earth Engine to give the participants practical skills to master the platform and implement their remote sensing projects.

## Objectives

The main objective is to train GIS and Remote Sensing Experts on the SCAFS project in the basics of satellite image
processing in the [Google Earth Engine (GEE)](https://earthengine.google.com/) Environment by leveraging on the Google Earth
high-resolution imagery and the GEE cloud-based data processing capacities for land use
mapping, spatiotemporal analysis on forest monitoring and cartographic visualization.

1. Introduce the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) model
2. Work through application examples
3. Facilitate a dissemination workshop on the map outputs
